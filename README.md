Only the MMCSVM development model does not fail in WPF development.

MMCSVM (model + markup + code-behind + singleton view model) development model has the best development speed in WPF development method.

Implementation is completed in one-fifth the man-hours compared to the MVVM development model.

All the projects that fail in WPF development adopt MVVM and fail by bloating the man-hours.
For system development, bloated man-hours are an irrecoverable fatal injury, but inexperienced leaders and leaders who do not conduct technical research themselves will inevitably lead to bloated man-hours and lead to project failure.
Internally, "the leader is incompetent", but from the outside it is seen as "disintermediation". The failure pattern of Japanese IT general contractors is this everywhere.

WPF development can be freed from such a situation by adopting the MMCSVM development model.
"Release from MVVM", "Release from bloated man-hours", "Release from development failure", these alone are enough reasons to adopt the MMCSVM development model.

Since the source code implemented in the MMCSVM development model has been released to GitHub, I would like WPF developers to learn the structure of this source code and work on the development method of WPF development.
Implemented with the latest framework (Visual Studio 2019 + .Net 5 + WPF + C#).
